### 🤖 [Quiz Data Processing](https://github.com/linhnde/quiz-data-processing){:target="_blank"}

In this project, we will build a Jupyter notebook to create a synthetic quiz dataset for using in web application.

I use Vertex AI to generate text data mimics quiz which input by human in common format. From the mockup document, we will load, extract and process, re-engineer it into JSON format which is widely used for web application.

### 🧐 [Exam Practice (Flask base)](https://github.com/linhnde/exam-practice-flask){:target="_blank"}

Simulating a demand for practicing on certain quiz set, I create this web app, Exam Practice (EP).

Originally, app was built on Tkinter. But later I adapted it on Flask to take advantages of responsive designing.

Using Google Cloud Run for deploying, we can save expense significantly in the early stage 
as we don't have to worry about 24/7 uptime bill.

Google Cloud Run also makes it easy to scale up the infrastructures if we need.
